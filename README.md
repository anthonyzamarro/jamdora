# Jamdora

I wanted a way to listen to the "marked" songs found on phish.net, so I decided to use their API to compile either user-generated lists or randomly generated lists of these marked songs and listen to them. 

A live version of the app so far: https://anthonyzamarro.github.io/jamdora/

This project uses React.
